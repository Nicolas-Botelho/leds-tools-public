**Code Wise** is a Visual Studio Code extension that automatically **analyzes** your codebase at pre-commit, leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Ollama, Mistral, and others. It helps developers identify **architectural** improvements, **SOLID** principle violations, **code smells**, and suggest **design patterns** â€” all seamlessly integrated into their daily workflow.

### Overview

Once installed and configured, CodeWise operates silently in the background. It monitors your Git repository for new commits and automatically triggers a set of intelligent agents that review the code changes, offering structured, insightful feedback saved directly into your workspace.
