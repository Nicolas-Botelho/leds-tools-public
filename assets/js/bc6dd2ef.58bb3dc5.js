Therefore, languages like Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) were used in monolithic structures, linking the frontend with the database through preprocessing."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"As time passed, the internet grew in importance, and many devices, particularly smartphones, needed to access it. Due to differences in screen sizes and compatibility, in order for a person using a mobile device to access a website with quality, it was often necessary to reimplement parts of the business logic in the responsive modules of the system, greatly increasing development costs. Thus, a migration process began from the monolithic structure to the separation of the frontend and backend, where the latter is mostly configured as a REST API. With the formal division between backend and frontend, the creation of responsiveness for a website to work on both computers and mobile devices no longer influences business logic; everything is contained in a single place."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"There are various ways to develop a frontend, and due to the difficulty of working solely and exclusively with the holy trinity, there was still a need for preprocessing HTML.
